# MSTU 5013 Final Project: VEGuality  

### By: Melissa Yeo, Brenda Khor, Dongxin Li

#### Design Executive Summary

* Strategy
    * <b>Problem</b>: We talked to vegans, and wanted to see what common problems they faced, and what could be done if they had a website. A lot of them talked about lack of food options; however, another theme that arose was lack of support. The problem is that is no platform for vegans to interact and engage with people who identify as vegans as well.
    * <b>User needs</b>: They need a platform to ask questions, comment, and feel a part of a community in relation to their vegan lifestyle. Also, it can provide vegan related resources in 1 location to explore and be an outlet to share experiences and stories.
    * <b>Goal/ How the project solves the problem</b>: The fact that vegans do not feel supported and alone with their choice of lifestyle, we wanted to bridge the gap between loneliness and wanting to feel apart of a community. This website will help to not only serve as access of resources but also a forum to engage and interact with other people who identify as vegans, and can ask questions and comment on their own experiences. We want to build a space for them to interact with other people to gain insight or to even share their own experiences and expertise.    
    * <b>Target Audience</b>: Vegans and people who want to find out more about the vegan movement
* Scope
    * Inline with the information surfaced through our interviews, we decided that the following would be our navbar tabs and related content
        * Switch - What's veganism, myths, tips, etc (switch.tag)
        * Cook - Recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner) (cook.tag)
        * Explore - what you can eat at restaurants if vegan, fashion, friendly cities, follow the movement events (explore.tag)
        * Inspire - Video (inspire others to eat with care), how to talk to others, motivating texts (inspire.tag)
        * Connect - a way to interact with other people, post questions, and comment on other people's questions (connect.tag, question.tag, comments.tag)
            * Arranged by time stamp
        * Profile - contain grocery list, my questions, and my story (and can delete) (profile.tag, grocery-list.tag, my-questions.tag, q-item.tag, comments.tag, my-stories.tag, story-item.tag)
